# Discovering Fast High-Fidelity Transmon Qubit Readout Protocols using Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains all the code for this project. The code is split into

1. Reinforcement Learning Side
2. Experiments Side

The Reinforcement Learning Side focuses on the Langevin-based Readout Simulations, and using Reinforcement Learning on these simulations to determine optimal readout pulses.

The Experiments Side delves into the pulse-level experiments to charecterize the ibmq devices, determine the optimal readout shape, and test the quality of the Novel Readout discovered using Reinforcement Learning.
